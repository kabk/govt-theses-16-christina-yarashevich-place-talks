      </br>insist on a crucial role of graphic design in the modern realities. We have been taught about the importance of critical thinking within our profession. Nowadays the graphic designer should be socially engaged and responsible for own decisions, not only as professionals but also as citizens. 

      <span class="otherParagraphs">This is a great attitude towards graphic design. It helps to realize the importance of your own actions and choices as a graphic designer. Nevertheless, these are loud statements, but the language with which graphic design speaks is more quite. Using instruments of graphic design you mainly influence the subconscious of people. Not everyone is aware that he or she has made a certain choice or decision based on subconscious aesthetic preferences, which the designer was able to skillfully appeal.
      </span>

      <span class="otherParagraphs"> This is the strength of graphic design. It can influence and educate unnoticeably by a nonprofessional viewer. That is the reason I am convinced that the power of design is not in the revolutionary slogans, but in the opportunity to affect human consciousness and to form aesthetic values. You cannot change the world with the poster in one day, but with your work you can build certain aesthetic surroundings for human existence, which will influence and educate their worldview.

In this thesis, I want to consider the impact of built environment on humans and what role graphic design plays in it. It could be argued that the visual, aesthetic and cultural identity of the build environment is made up of, amongst other things, its graphical elements. More specifically, I want to consider the role of typography in the construction of experience of space. Typography in the architectural environment can thus be studied as part of a place’s identity. That is the reason why this research investigates the link between architecture and typography.</span></p>

      is going to elaborate on the typographical presence of linguistic units in the built environment. The research is mainly illustrated by examples of typographical interventions from Western English-speaking countries. These restrictions applied due to linguistic barrier and inability to look closer at the examples with different linguistic background. However, value of typography described in this thesis can be applied in different cultural settings.

      <span class="otherParagraphs">In the first chapter the influence of architecture on the psychological state of people and
      the formation of personal identity is investigated. The second chapter describes the current architectural frame in which typography might operate. The third chapter illustrates the importance of typography in the creation of place identity. In the fourth and the fifth chapter we take a closer look on the specification and categorization of typography. It also introduces a possibility to distinguish a specific kind of typography in the built environment, such as expressive typography. Additionally, this research covers the study of Supergraphics as an important historical instance. The last chapter emphasizes the difference between expressive typography and other types. It also elaborates on an opportunity to apply accrued knowledge about expressive typography in different contexts of usage in space.</span>

    Architecture </a> <span class="hidden" id="chapterOne1">
    <span>is the most direct way through which humans are connected with the world around them. Mass and space are two main architectural ingredients.  An architect operates them and by that makes a statement about the interrelationship of man with his universe. The abstract and indefinable notion of cosmos is always somehow present and represented in architecture and the human landscape. Landscapes and buildings are thus condensed worlds – microcosmic representations – and, consequently, the space built for human habitation is also, always, a metaphorical space.  As philosopher Karsten Harries argues, “Chaos must be transformed into cosmos. When we reduce the human need for shelter to a material need, we lose sight of what we can call the ethical function of architecture.”

    Architecture in this sense is never just a provider of shelter, but, more importantly, it forms and expresses man’s ideology.
    </span>

    <span class="otherParagraphs">Historical examples of architectural constructions from various cultures illustrate a different attitude towards the world around. Egyptian, Chinese, Islamic, and Christian buildings manifest completely different cultural and philosophical ideas. Architecture in these cases becomes a horn of cultural expression.</span>

    <span class="otherParagraphs">But the process of expression of cultural constructions never works one way. It is always a bilateral process. To a certain extent the architecture expresses world views, it also affects them. People settle into the space, and the space dwells in people; architecture becomes part of them and they become part of it. A profound work of architecture does not remain outside us as a separate object; people live and experience themselves through the work, and it guides, directs and conditions the way they understand themselves to exist in the world. This tension between architecture being defined by what people can perceive and what people can perceive by being continually redefined by the architecture they imagine, is fundamental to understanding architecture as experience.

    Venetian philosopher Giambattista Vico said “Verum Ipsum Factum”, which means that “we can only know what human beings have made”. The surroundings that people build for themselves shapes them through their experience of it, changing the future even as it stands as the most telling record of the present in which it was made.

        <span class="hidden" id="chapterOne2">
        <span>is the concept developed by Fredric Jameson. He took the term from Kevin Lynch´s The Image of the City. In this work, Lynch wrote about the importance of man’s ability ‘to map (in their minds) their own positions or the urban totality in which they find themselves’. In other words, it describes the phenomenon by which people make sense of their urban surroundings. It can be understood as a transitional area between the personal and social. It allows people to function more effectively in the urban spaces through which they move.</span>


        <span class="otherParagraphs">Jameson elaborated the theory of cognitive perception and made it into a metaphor for the model of how we might begin to articulate the local and the global. This model provides a way of linking the most intimately local – our particular path through the world – and the most global – the crucial features of political planet.

        He saw a crucial link between the existential features (the position of the individual subject, the experience of daily life, the monadic “point of view” on the world) and vast and properly unpresentable totality which is the ensemble of society’s structures as a whole.

    <span>and mass are equally important to the architectural task of creating a living environment for people. Consequently, the way architecture approaches the space plays an essential role. It becomes, not merely a medium of guiding behavior, it is also an intentional means of mental and artistic communication, and an object of aesthetic articulation. People grasp the space through their senses and measure it with their bodies and movements. Space becomes an extension of people’s bodies beyond their skin, and the physical space and the mental spaces fuse. Architectural space mediates between the world at large and the human domain, the physical and the mental, the material and the spiritual.

    <span class="otherParagraphs">Environmental psychologist Harold Proshansky declares that place identity has been traditionally defined as a sub-structure of the self-identity of the person. He described the incorporation of place identity into the concept of individual’s self and emphasized significance of places for their inhabitants and users.</span>

    <span class="otherParagraphs">Erik. H. Erikson, psychoanalyst and educator, developed the concept of the extension of the room of interplay which he related to the life circle. He introduces the idea of “forbidding environment” in contrast to “facilitating environment,” and showed how the balance between these two may affect one’s response to the various turning points in one’s life, strengthening or inhibiting the full realization of one’s potential.

        <span class="otherParagraphs">The physical settings influence the way people feel themselves within the space. When a person interacts with various places in life, he/she can evaluate and make his or her own assumption about an ideal satisfying perception of the place. All experience connected with places forms the environmental past of person. But individuals very often stay unconscious of the array of feelings, values or memories of a specific place and simply becomes more comfortable or uncomfortable with certain physical settings, or prefer specific spaces to others.

      According to the poet Joseph Brodsky, “Be like me” is the moral command of a work of art in general. Well-thought-out places are able to facilitate positive transformation of the community in general. Viennese philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein said “Ethics and aesthetics are one”. </span>

    <span class="otherParagraphs">Viewed in this light, the role of the designer acquires an important dimension. It is not to create facades or architectural mass but to create settings for a totally harmonious life experience. Architecture is the articulation of space so as to produce a definite space experience in relation to previous and anticipated space experiences.

    DUCK </a> </br> <span class="hidden" id="chapterTwo2">
    <span>In case, the architectural systems of space, structure, and program are submerged and distorted by an overall symbolic form, this kind of building-becoming-structure authors called the DUCK in honor of duck-shaped drive-in “The Long Island Duckling”. They are buildings that can’t be anything but what they are as their shape foretells the activity taking place inside. They do not require signs, often blurring the line between building and sculpture. Ducks have innate ornamentation and are straightforward and honest in their intentions. What you see is what you get, and what you get is what you would expect.</span>

    <span class="otherParagraphs">This sort of building became a characteristic feature of the transformation of architecture in the time of high modernism and so-called international style. The buildings of this period were separated from its surrounding context. They became break points in the fabric of the traditional city and its older neighborhood culture. Unlike one of the main characteristic of postmodernism is the erasure of the border between high culture and so-called mass and commercial culture. In this setting the other kind of buildings became more common.</span></span>

    DECORATED SHED </a> </br> <span class="hidden" id="chapterTwo3">
    <span>Where systems of space and structure are directly at the service of program, and ornament is applied independently of them. Venturi and co-authors called this the DECORATED SHED.
    Decorated shed carries a connection between modernist architecture and historical associations. Modernist architects are too convinced that form can exist out of any historical or cultural frame. And that these abstract forms can affect person just by mean of mass and space. However examples of different perception of the same forms, symbols and objects in different cultures can prove that it is difficult to create something universal and out of any context. It is hard to rely just on the physiological features of humans in order to build any elaborative architectural structure. In its turn decorated shed is a generic structure with a purpose identifiable only by its signage. In fact, decorated sheds could not exist without signs and other applied ornamentation. Unlike ducks, they are not symbols themselves, but require applied symbols.

    <span class="otherParagraphs">Implicit in the pure architectural forms of “duck” is a symbolism different from the applique ornament of “decorated shed” with its explicit associations.

      The viewers read the implicit symbolism of “duck” through the undecorated physiognomy of building. In order to do it, they should use their associations and past experience. However, the abstract expressionistic messages of “decorated shed” can be perceived through the inherent physiognomic characteristics of its forms–size, texture, color, and additional elements as signs or lettering.</span>

    <span class="otherParagraphs">Such type of building as “decorated shed” often “exists” if there are some distinguished elements on them. They exist only if there are symbols/elements which differ them from other buildings. By definition they are as white and blank as a white sheet of paper lying in front of a writer. They are neutral and silent before a writer will bring it into life.</span>

    Modern </a> <span class="hidden" id="chapterTwo4">
    <span>built environment is mainly constructed out of buildings which we bravely can refer to as “decorative shed”. However, build settings have meaning, and matter to people only when it is experienced, when all human’s senses are simultaneously engaged in its inhabitation, and when it provides conditions in which the acts and rituals of daily life take place. Therefore it is important to realize the significant contribution of additional visual elements to the creation of a comfortable living environment. In order to distinguish lived space (space which is comfortable to be in) from physical and geometrical space, we can use the term existential space.

      This is something which appears only by a perception of people who live in this space and experience it. The whole lived experiential world is a mosaic of places, next to and nested inside each other; it is not a continuous, unstructured and homogeneous space devoid of meanings. The experience of place is fundamental for our mental constitution and environmental perception, as well as for our innate structuring of the world.

     <span class="otherParagraphs">According to psychologist Gabriel Moser the relation between individual and environment may be approached depending on four different levels of space and time references:</span></br>
