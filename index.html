with graphic design. Graphic design is constantly presented in our
surroundings. As architecture, it also builds aesthetic conditions
and models of human behavior in everyday life.

It could be argued that the visual, aesthetic and cultural identity
of the build environment is made up of, amongst other things,
by its graphical elements. Typography is one of the fields in graphic
design which has a significant presence in the built environment.
Words are getting noticed almost immediately. They communicate
information to people and directly affect people’s consciousness.
This is what makes typography so influential.</span>

<p>My thesis introduces the research question: <br>
<b>How does typography influence the spatial experience of people in the public space? </b><br>
In order to answer this question, I researched the field of typography, architecture and environmental psychology.</p>

<p>The text investigates and establishes the link between typography
and architecture. It provides historical and contemporary examples
of the usage of lettering in architectural space. Which was done
to emphasize the deep roots of coexistence of these two field of
arts. Additionally, with this instances it describes the features and
possibilities of typography within the architectural environment.</p>

<p>The research demonstrates the relationship between humans state,
behavior and their physical environment. Therefore it introduces the
necessary theoretical background of environmental psychology.
This thesis is meant to explain and illustrate an important role of
typography in the creation of suitable living conditions for humans.

<div id="introduction">
<div ><a name="menu2"><h1>Introduction</h1></a></div>

<p>Graphic designers insist on crucial role of graphic design in the modern realities.
We have been taught about importance of critical thinking within our profession.
That nowadays graphic designer should be socially engaged and be responsible
for your own decisions not only as professionals but also as a citizens.  </p>

<p>This is a great attitude towards the graphic design. It helps to realize the importance
of your own actions and choices as a graphic designer. Nevertheless, this is loud
statements, but the language with which graphic design speaks is more quite.
Using instruments of graphic design you mostly influence the subconscious
of people. Not everyone is aware that he/she has made a certain choice or decision
based on subconscious aesthetic preferences, which the designer was able
to skillfully appeal.</p>

<p> This is the strength of graphic design. It can influence and educate unnoticeably
by nonprofessional viewer. That is the reason I convinced that the power of design
is not in the revolutionary slogans, but in the opportunity to affect human
consciousness and to form aesthetic values. You cannot change the world with the
poster, but you can build such aesthetic conditions and models of human behavior
in everyday life, which will influence and educate their worldview.</p>

<p>In this thesis, I want to consider the impact of built environment on humans.
Nowadays the urban (build) environment become the main surroundings for humanity.
It has the most influencial power to shape people’s views. There is the important
relationship between man and his visual environment. That is the reason why this
research investigate the link between architecture and graphic design. Graphic design
and architecture have coexisted in the built environment for centuries.<!--<a href="#fn2" name="fr2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>-->

<p>It could be argued that the visual, aesthetic and cultural identity of the build
environment is made up of, amongst other things, its graphical elements. Typography
in the urban environment can thus be studied as part of place’s identity. Therefore
I see a potential and the necessity of rethinking the role of typography within the
urban environment.</p>

<p>The following thesis introduces the research question: How does typography
influence the spatial experience of people in the public spaces?
The research covers the study of the environment psychology which establishes the
relationship between human behavior and conditions and their physical environment.
However, mainly the thesis describe the features and possibilities of typography
within the architectural environment.</p><Br>


<div id="influence">
<div ><a name="menu3"><h1>Influence of space</h1></a></div>

<p>Man could not live without interaction with the world around. All actions, feelings
and thoughts of person conditioned by the surrounding he lives in. Fundamentally
human communicate with universe or nature through his living environment. In
the modern times when more than a half of world’s population lives in urban areas
build environment become significantly important in formation of human’s life
conditions.</p>

<p>Architecture is the most direct way through which human connected with the
world around. By operating of two main architectural ingredients – mass and
space –architect makes a statement about the interrelationship of man and his
universe. The abstract and indefinable notion of cosmos is always somehow present and represent in architecture and the human landscape. Landscapes and
buildings are thus condensed worlds – microcosmic representations – and, consequently, the space built for human habitation is always also metaphorical space.
(UA) Architecture in this sense is never just a provider of the shelter but more
importantly it forms and expresses man’s ideology.</p>

<p>Historical examples of architectural constructions from various cultures illustrate
a different attitude towards the world around. Egyptian, Chinese, Islamic, Christian buildings manifests completely different cultural and philosophical ideas.
Architecture in these cases become a horn of cultural expression.
But the process of expression ideology never works in one way. It is always a bilateral process. To the extent the architecture express world views, it is also affect
it. People settle into the space, and the space dwells in people; architecture becomes part of them and they become part of it. A profound work of architecture
does not remain outside us as a separate object; people live and experience themselves through the work, and it guides, direct and conditions the way they understand themselves to be in the world. This tension between architecture being
defined by what people can perceived and what people can perceived being continually redefined by the architecture we imagine, is fundamental to understanding architecture as experience. (UndArch).
Venetian philosopher Giambattista Vico said “Verum Ipsum Factum”, which mean
that “we can only know what human beings have made”. The surroundings that
people build for themselves shapes them through their experience of it, changing
the future even as it stands as the most telling record of the present in which it
was made. (UA)
Since mass and space are equally important to the architectural task of creation
living environment for people, the way architecture approach the space plays an
essential role. It becomes not merely a medium of guiding behavior, it is also an
intentional means of mental and artistic communication, and an object of aesthetic articulation. People grasp the space through their senses and measure it
with their bodies and movements. Space become an extension of people’s bodies
beyond their skin, and the physical space and the mental spaces fuse with each
other. Architectural space mediates between the world at large and the human
domain, the physical and the mental, the material and the spiritual. (UA)
Environmental psychologist Harold Proshansky declare that place identity has
been traditionally defined as a sub-structure of the self-identity of the person. He
described the incorporation of place identity into the concept of individual’s self
4
and emphasized significance of places for their inhabitants and users.</p>

<div id="archAndType">
<div ><a name="menu4"><h1>Architecture and typography<br></h1></a></div>

<p>Graphic design by its nature is not meant to provide fundamental living structures.
Graphic designers do not build world around by means of bricks and concrete, but
they provide the space with the unique layer of visual information. Using typography, colour, light and other different means of expression graphic design can form
specific atmosphere of the space.
Build settings have meaning, and matter to people only when it is experienced,
when all human’s senses are simultaneously engaged in its inhabitation, and when
it provides conditions in which the acts and rituals of daily life takes place. Graphic design is able to contribute to the creation of place identity on a par with architecture.
Place identity which is so important for a contribution in the formation of uniqueness of space, very often cannot be expressed just by means of architecture.
Graphics and typography which are used in the build environment become a specific marks of places. In addition to the inherent utilitarian purposes of architecture, graphic design can express a significant existential and mental task. It is
able to domesticate man-made structures for human occupation by turning anonymous and uniforms spaces into distinct places of human significance.</p>
